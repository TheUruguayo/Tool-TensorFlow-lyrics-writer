Something has to change 
Un-deniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear 
Constant over stimu-lation numbs me and I wouldn't have
It any other way 
It's not enough 
I need more 
Nothing seems to satisfy 
I don't want it 
I just need it 
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive 
Finger deep within the borderline 
Show me that you love me and that we belong together 
Relax, turn around and take my hand 
I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure 
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way 
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
Till you will not have me any other way 
It's not enough 
I need more 
Nothing seems to satisfy 
I don't want it 
I just need it 
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive 
Knuckle deep inside the borderline 
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to 
Relax  
Slip away 
Something kinda sad about the way that things have come to be 
Desensitized to everything 
What became of subtlety?
How can it mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging till I feel something 
Elbow deep inside the borderline 
Show me that you love me and that we belong together 
Shoulder deep within the borderline 
Relax  Turn around and take my hand 
He had alot to say 
He had alot of nothing to say 
We'll miss him 
So long 
We wish you well 
You told us how you weren't afraid to die Well then, so long 
Don't cry Or feel too down 
Not all martyrs see divinity But at least you tried 
Standing above the crowd He had a voice that was strong and loud We'll miss him 
Ranting and pointing his finger At everything but his heart 
We'll miss him 
No way to recall What it was that you had said to me Like I care at all 
So loud You sure could yell 
You took a stand on every little thing And so loud 
Standing above the crowd He had a voice so strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way, with Someone who would die for me 
Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin lie 
Don't you step out of line 
Don't you fuckin lie 
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me 
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?
You had alot to say 
You had alot of nothing to say 
Come down 
Get off your fuckin cross 
We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr 
To ascend you must die 
You must be crucified
For your sins and your lies  [sic]
Goodbye   
What's coming through is alive 
What's holding up is a mirror 
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this piss to wine 
They're both totally void of hate,
But killing me just the same 
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been 
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again 
And I feel this coming over like a storm again 
Considerately 
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty 
Drags me down like some sweet gravity 
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been 
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again 
And I feel this coming over like a storm again 
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away 
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me 
Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down 
And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times 
I could have cried then 
I should have cried then 
And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
and will die 
It's all right 
I don't mind 
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away 
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me 
My shadow's
shedding skin and
I've been picking
Scabs again 
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue 
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been 
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in 
I wanna feel the changes coming down 
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow 
Change is coming through my shadow 
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again 
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been 
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
And insecure delusions 
I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in 
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured within
My shadow
Change is coming 
Now is my time 
Listen to my muscle memory 
Contemplate what I've been clinging to 
Forty-six and two ahead of me 
I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give and to
Move, learn and love and to
Cry, kill and die and to
Be paranoid and to
Lie, hate and fear and to
Do what it takes to move through 
I choose to live and to
Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and love and to
Do what it takes to step through 
See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me 
Soften this old armor 
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side 
Step into the shadow 
Forty six and two are just ahead of me 
Hm? You think you're cool, right? Hm? Hm?
When you kicked out people [out of] your house
I tell you this, one of three Americans die of cancer,
you know? Asshole  You're gonna be one of those 
I [don't have the] courage
to kick your ass directly 
Don't have enough courage for that,
I could, you know 
You know you're gonna have another accident?
You know I'm involved with black magic?
Fuck you  Die  Bastard 
You think you're so cool, hm? Asshole 
And if I ever see your fucking face around,
In Europe or Italy,
Well I'll -- That time I'm gonna kick your ass 
Fuck you  Fucking Americans, Yankee 
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise 
No one does what you did to me 
You wanna know something? Fuck you 
I want your balls smashed, eat shit  Bastard 
I hope somebody in your family dies soon 
Son of a bitch, do you know you are a piece of shit?
Piece of shit, son of a bitch 
Die, piece of shit, and go suck dicks on a plane!
I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s, and a
Dope Beastie t, nipple rings, and
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
From '92,
The first EP 
And in between
Sips of Coke
He told me that
He thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up
To the man 
Well now I've got some
A-dvice for you, little buddy 
Before you point the finger
You should know that
I'm the man,
And if I'm the man,
Then you're the man, and
He's the man as well so you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass 
All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck 
I sold out long before you ever heard my name 
I sold my soul to make a record,
Dip shit,
And you bought one 
So I've got some
Advice for you, little buddy 
Before you point your finger
You should know that
I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass 
All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck 
I sold out long before you ever heard my name 
I sold my soul to make a record,
Dip shit,
And you bought one 
All you read and
Wear or see and
Hear on TV
Is a product
Begging for your
Fatass dirty
Dollar
So   Shut up and
Buy my new record
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy
There are no words 
What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone 
Eleven is when we waved good-bye 
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him
By coming home 
Moving me with a sound 
Opening me within a gesture 
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven 
It took so long to realize that
You hold the light that's been leading me back home 
Under a dead ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light,
And wondering   
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping, lost, and numb 
So glad that I have found you 
I am wide awake and heading home 
Hold your light,
Eleven 
Lead me through each gentle step by step
by inch by loaded memory 
I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together 
Hold your light,
Eleven  Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory
'till one and one are one, eleven,
So glow, child, glow 
I'm heading back home 
I will choke until I swallow   
Choke this infant here before me 
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge and strike you down?
But you're
Pushing and shoving me 
You still love me and you pushit on me 
Rest your trigger on my finger,
bang my head upon the fault line 
Take care not to make me enter 
'cause if I do we both may disappear 
But you're pushing me,
Shoving me  Pushit on me 
Slipping back into the gap again 
I'm alive when you're touching me,
Alive when you're shoving me down 
But i'd trade it all
For just a little bit of
Piece of mind 
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be 
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see 
Never wanna see that place again 
Saw that gap again today
As you were begging me to stay 
Managed to push myself away,
And you, as well 
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way 
There's no love in fear 
Staring down the hole again 
Hands upon my back again 
Survival is my only friend 
Terrified of what may come 
Just remember I will always love you,
Even as I tear your fucking throat away 
But it will end no other way 
Some say the end is near 
Some say we'll see armageddon soon 
I certainly hope we will 
I sure could use a vacation from this
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away 
Any fucking time  Any fucking day 
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay 
Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your lawsuit and
Fret for your prozac and
Fret for your pilot and
Fret for your contract and
Fret for your car 
It's a
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away 
Any fucking time  Any fucking day 
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay 
Some say a comet will fall from the sky 
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves 
Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still 
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits 
Some say the end is near 
Some say we'll see armageddon soon 
I certainly hope we will cuz
I sure could use a vacation from this
Silly shit, stupid shit   
One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied 
Learn to swim 
Mom's gonna fix it all soon 
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be 
Learn to swim 
Fuck L Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones 
Fuck all those gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes 
Learn to swim 
Fuck retro anything 
Fuck your tattoos 
Fuck all you junkies and
Fuck your short memory 
Learn to swim 
Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas 
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses 
Learn to swim 
Cuz I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way 
I wanna watch it all go down 
Mom please flush it all away 
I wanna watch it go right in and down 
I wanna watch it go right in 
Watch you flush it all away 
Time to bring it down again 
Don't just call me pessimist 
Try and read between the lines 
I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend 
I wanna see it all come down 
suck it down 
flush it down 
Dreaming of that face again 
It's bright and blue and shimmering 
Grinning wide
And comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes 
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye 
In    Out    In    Out    In    Out   
A child's rhyme stuck in my head 
It said that life is but a dream 
I've spent so many years in question
to find I've known this all along 
"So good to see you 
I've missed you so much 
So glad it's over 
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play 
Why are you running?"
Shroud-ing all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me 
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun 
I stick my hand into his shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand 
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been 
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar 
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song   
"So good to see you 
I've missed you so much 
So glad it's over 
I've missed you so much 
Came out to watch you play 
Why are you running away?"
Prying open my third eye 
So good to see you once again 
I thought that you were hiding 
And you thought that I had run away 
Chasing the tail of dogma 
I opened my eye and there we were 
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me 
And you thought that I had run away 
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason 
Prying open my third eye 
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity 
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate 
Desperate to control all and everything 
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Terrified of being wrong  Ultimatum prison cell 
Saturn ascends, choose one or ten  Hang on or be humbled again 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end 
Saturn ascends, comes round again 
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten  Ignorant to the damage done 
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity 
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate 
Desperate to control all and everything 
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen 
Wear the grudge like a crown  Desperate to control 
Unable to forgive  And we're sinking deeper 
Defining, confining, controlling, and we're sinking deeper 
Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent 
Saturn comes back around  Lifts you up like a child or
Drags you down like a stone
To consume you till you choose to let this go 
Give away the stone 
Let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor 
Give away the stone 
Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold 
Let go 
A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful 
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on 
Draining patience, drain vitality 
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old 
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here 
Wait it out,
Gonna wait it out,
Be patient (wait it out) 
If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now 
Gonna wait it out 
If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now 
And I still may     (sigh)     I still may 
Be patient 
I must keep reminding myself of this 
And if there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now 
And I still may 
Gonna wait it out 
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering  Fundamental differing 
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication 
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over 
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it 
Finding beauty in the dissonance 
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away 
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication 
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers/brothers 
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now 
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful 
Wide eyed and hopefully wild 
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now  Hold on, stay inside   
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal  All this pain is an illusion 
We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment,
We are choosing to be here right now  Hold on, stay inside
This holy reality, this holy experience 
Choosing to be here in
This body  This body holding me  Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion 
Alive, I
In this holy reality, in this holy experience  Choosing to be here in
This body  This body holding me  Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion 
Twirling round with this familiar parable 
Spinning, weaving round each new experience 
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing 
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality 
Embrace this moment  Remember  We are eternal 
All this pain is an illusion 
Suck and suck 
Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck 
Workin up under my patience like a little tick 
Fat little parasite 
Suck me dry 
My blood is bruised and borrowed  You thieving bastards 
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue 
Hope this is what you wanted 
Hope this is what you had in mind 
Cuz this is what you're getting 
I hope you're choking  I hope you choke on this 
Taken all I can, taken all I can, we(?) can take 
Taken all you can, taken all you can fuckin' take
Got nothing left to give to you 
Blood suckin parasitic little tick/blood suckin parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go 
Hope this is what you wanted 
Hope this is what you had in mind 
Cuz this is what you're getting 
Suck me dry 
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you had in mind?
Cuz this this is what you're getting 
I hope you choke 
Black then white are all I see in my infancy 
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me 
lets me see 
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
drawn beyond the lines of reason 
Push the envelope  Watch it bend 
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind 
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines 
Black then white are all I see in my infancy 
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me 
lets me see there is so much more
and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities 
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
drawn outside the lines of reason 
Push the envelope  Watch it bend 
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind 
Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind 
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line 
Reaching out to embrace the random 
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come 
I embrace my desire to
feel the rhythm, to feel connected
enough to step aside and weep like a widow
to feel inspired, to fathom the power,
to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
to swing on the spiral
of our divinity and still be a human 
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
between the sounds and open wide to suck it in,
I feel it move across my skin 
I'm reaching up and reaching out,
I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me 
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been 
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been 
Spiral out  Keep going, going
Mention this to me
Mention something, mention anything
    and watch the weather change 
I have come curiously close to the end, down
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,
Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me   
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret - my confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
Its source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism 
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
Before I pine away 
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable 
Just let the light touch you
And let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason
before we pine away
Eye on the TV
'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be

Like:
"Killed by the husband"    
"Drowned by the ocean"    
"Shot by his own son"    
"She used a poison in his tea,
Then (she) kissed him goodbye"
That's my kind of story
It's no fun til someone dies 

Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other (you)
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child,
Watches him die,
Hands to the sky cryin "why, oh why?"

Cause I need to watch things die from a distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too - don't lie 

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
Neither the brave nor bold
Nor brightest of stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'

I need to watch things die from a good safe distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same so why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain fallin' down
Drum on grave and ground

Part vampire, part warrior,
Carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal 
Sing to the death rattle 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie (x4)

Credulous at best
Your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men 
But pull your head on out (of) your hippie haze
And give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again

The universe is hostile
So impersonal
Devour to survive
So it is, so it's always been    

We all feed on tragedy 
It's like blood to a vampire 

Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I 


Here from a kings mountain view
Here from the wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few
But I would wish it all, away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day
The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown 

But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me round
So I, I would wish this all away
Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along
But I
I would
If I could
I would
Wish it away
Wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away

No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center
So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away 
You, my piece of mind, my all, my center,
just trying to hold on one more day 
Damn my eyes!

Damn my eyes!
If they should compromise the fulcrum:
(If) wants and needs divide me
Then I might as well be gone   
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the broken
Shine until the two become one
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the severed
Shine until the two become one
Divided, I'll wither away
Shine down upon the many 
Light our way, benevolent sun 
Breathe in union

So, as one, survive
Another day and season
Silence, legion  Save your poison 
Silence, legion  Stay out of my way 


You   
You believed    
You believed in movements none could see 
You believed in me

A passionate spirit
Uncompromised
Boundless and open
A light in your eyes
Then immobilized 

Broken
Fell at the hands of those movements that I wouldn't see
Yet it was you who prayed for me 
So what have I done
To be a son to an angel?
What have I done
To be worthy?

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?
"She never told a lie,
    well might have told a lie,
But never lived one 
Didn't have a life,
Didn't have a life,
But surely saved one "
See? I'm alright
Now it's time for us to let you go 


Listen to the tales and romanticize,
How we'd follow the path of the hero 
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun 
How we rise to the height of our halo 

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior,
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations;
None of us have actually been there 
Not like you 

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me 
None of them can even hold a candle up to you 
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see 

But, enough about the collective Judas 
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me;
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way,
Your way home    

Oh, what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground 
You were the light and the way they'll only read about 
I only pray, Heaven knows when to lift you out 
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough;
You're going home 

You're the only one who can hold your head up high,
Shake your fists at the gates saying:
"I've come home now!
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father 
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended 
It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my, give me my wings!"

You are the light and way that they will only read about 

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance,
(With the) burden of proof tossed upon the believers 
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one 

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents 
Difficult to see you in this light 
Please forgive this bold suggestion, but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight,
Look Him in the eye, look Him in the eye, and tell Him:
"I never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one 
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home "


Who are you to wave your finger?
You must have been outta your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead

Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around

You must have been high

Foot in mouth and head up ass
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'til you pull it out  boy,

You must have been so high

Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the jury with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle 

You must have been high!

Who are you to wave your finger?
So full of it
Eye balls deep in muddy waters
Fuckin' hypocrite

Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me  What's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent 

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle 

You must've been   

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
You must have been out your mind

Weepin' shades of indigo
Shed without a reason *
Weepin' shades of indigo

Liar, lawyer - mirror, for you what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned  He's guilty as the government 

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle 

You must've been high!

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Ganja? P-lease!
You must have been out your mind

Alrighty, then     picture this if you will 

10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes,
in my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
when a flaming stealth banana split the sky
like one would hope but never really expect
to see in a place like this 
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
and stopping right at my Birkenstocks,
and me yelping   
Holy fucking shit!

Then the X-Files being,
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
with Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw,
and my sweaty L  Ron Hubbard upper lip,
and all I could think was:
"I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
that I pissed my fuckin' pants "

So light in his way,
Like an apparition, [that]
He had me crying out,
"Fuck me
It's gotta be
the Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got [right] on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!"

And after calming me down
with some orange slices
and some fetal spooning,
E T  revealed to me his singular purpose 
He said, "You are the Chosen One,
the One who will deliver the message 
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
and a warning for those who do not "
Me  The Chosen One?
They chose me!!!
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school 

You'd better   
You'd better   
You'd better   
You'd better listen 

Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

I can't breathe right now!

It was so real,
Like I woke up in Wonderland 
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story 
And can anyone tell me why
Y'all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

I can't breathe right now!

You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said!
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head 
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in 
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin 

Strapped down [to] my bed
Feet cold [and] eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed 

Hey    

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position 
Such a heavy burden now to be the One
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending,
To write it down for all the world to see 

But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again    
Typical 

Strapped down [to] my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist * and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed
I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said
Bob help me!
Can't remember what they said

[We] don't know, [and we] won't know (x12)
God damn, shit the bed!
Pure as we begin
Pure as we come in
Pure as we begin
Pure by will alone
Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Gather, place, [erase, so / a razor]
Shelter turned to home
Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Throw to stay the stranger
Swore to crush his bones
Move by will alone
Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Light the way or warm this
Hope we occupy
Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Forge a blade to slay the stranger
Take whatever we desire
Move by will alone
Pure as we begin
Pure as we begin
Move by will alone
Leave as we come in
Pure as light, return to one
Move by will alone

Angels on the sideline,
Puzzled and amused 
Why did Father* give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused 
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it right in two 
Angels on the sideline,
Baffled and confused 
Father blessed them all with reason,
And this is what they choose?
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground 
Silly monkeys 
Give them thumbs, they forge a blade,
And where there's one they're bound to divide it right in two 
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground 
Silly monkeys 
Give them thumbs, they make a club to beat their brother down 
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery 
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here 
Gotta divide it all right in two 
Fight till they die over sun, over sky,
They fight till they die over sea, over air,
They fight till they die over blood, over love,
They fight till they die over words, polarizing 
Angels on the sideline again,
Benched along with patience and reason 
Angels on the sideline again,
Wondering where this tug of war will end 
Gotta divide it all right in two 
Immunity, long Overdue  Contagion, I exhale you
Naïve, I opened up to you, venom and mania 
Now Contagion, I exhale you 

The Deceiver says, “You belong to me  You don’t wanna breath the light of the others 
Fear the light  Fear the breath  Fear the others for eternity ”
But I hear them now  Inhale the clarity  I hear the venom in what you say 

Inoculated 
Bless this immunity 

Exhale  Expel  Recast my tale  Weave my allegorical elegy 

Enumerate all that I’m to do  Calculating steps away from you 
My own mitosis, growing through division from mania 

Exhale  Expel  Recast my tale  Weave my allegorical elegy 

Forfeit all control, you Poison, you Spectacle 
Exorcise the Spectacle  Exorcise the malady 
Exorcize the disparate poison for eternity 

Purge me and Evacuate the Venom & the Fear that binds me 
Your veil now, lift away 

I see you running 

Deceiver, chased away  A Long time coming 
We are Spirit bound to this flesh 
(We) go round one foot nailed down 
(But) Bound to reach out and beyond this flesh, become Pneuma 
We are will and wonder, bound to recall – remember
We are Born of One Breath, One Word 
We are all One Spark, Sun becoming 

Child, wake up 
Child, release the light 
Wake up now, child 
Spirit…
Spirit bound to this flesh, this guise, this mask, this dream 
Wake up, remember –
We are born of One Breath, One Word 
We are all One Spark, Sun becoming 

Pneuma 
Reach out and beyond 
Wake up, remember 
We are born of One Breath, One Word 
We are all One Spark, eyes full of wonder 

Long in tooth and soul  Longing for another win 
Lurch into the fray  Weapon out and belly in 
Warrior struggling to remain consequential 

Bellow aloud, bold and proud, of where I’ve been  But here I am 
Beating chest and drums  Beating tired bones again 

Age old battle, mine  Weapon out and belly in 
Tales told of battles won, of things we’ve done, Caligula would grin 
Beating tired bones  Tripping through remember when 
Once invincible  Now the armor’s wearing thin 
Heavy shield down  Warrior struggling to remain relevant 
Warrior struggling to remain consequential 

Bellow aloud, bold and proud, of where I’ve been 
But here I am, where I end 

Tears in my eyes chasing Ponce de Leon’s phantoms 
So filled with hope I can taste mythical fountains 
False hope, perhaps,
But the truth never got in my way before now 
Feel the sting  Feeling time bearing down 
Free fall through our midnight, this epilogue of our own fable 
Heedless in our slumber 
Floating nescient we free fall through this boundlessness,
This madness of our own making 
Falling isn’t flying  Floating isn’t infinite…
Come, Our end, suddenly  All hail our lethargy  Concede Suddenly 
To the quickened dissolution 
Pray we Mitigate the ruin, calling all to arms and order 
Drifting through this boundlessness, this madness of our own making 
Sound our dire reveille  Rouse all from our apathy, lest we cease to be 
Stir us from our wanton slumber 
Mitigate our ruin 
Call us all to arms and order 
Sound the dread Alarm through our primal body 
Sound the reveille to be or not to be 
Rise  Stay the grand finale 
Stay the reading of our swan song & epilogue 
One Drive; To stay alive 
It’s Elementary  Muster every fiber  Mobilize  Stay Alive
Stir us from our wanton slumber  Mitigate our ruin 
Call us all to arms and order 
Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious tendencies 
(Hearing) Conversations we’ve never had 
Imagined interplay 
Psychopathy  Don’t You dare point that at me 

Heated altercations we’ve never had, (or) so I’m told
Yet guided by them all 
Every single one 

Psychopathy 
Misleading me over and over

Judge, Condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence 
Only the whispers from within 

Psychopathy 
Misleading me over and over 

Imagined interplay
Psychopathy  Don’t You dare point that at me 
There are no words 


(keep calm  Keepin it calm  Keep calm  FUCK  Here we go again)
Heat lightning flash, but don’t blink  Misleading  Tranquility ruse 
You’re gonna happen again  That’s what I think 
Follow the evidence  Look it dead in the eye  You are darkness 
Trying to Lull us in, before the havoc begins, into a dubious state of serenity 
Acting all surprised when you’re caught in the lie 

We know better  It’s not unlike you 
It’s not unlike you 
We know your nature 

Blame it all on the bastards when you’re blowin out 
Shame on you  Shame on you, now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up your petulant stench and demeanor 
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems 
We’re not buying your dubious state of serenity 
Acting all surprised when you’re caught in the lie 
We know better  It’s not unlike you
It’s not unlike you  We know your nature 

Calm before the torrent comes 
Calm before the 7empest comes to reign all over 
Disputing intentions invites devastation 
A 7empest must be true to its nature 
A 7empest will be just that 

Control, your delusion  Insane and striking at random 
Victim of your uncertainty, and therefore your doubt’s not an option 
Blameless, the 7empest must/will be just that 
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone 
Your words to erase all the damage cannot 

A 7empest will be just that 
I don't want to be hostile 
I don't want to be dismal 
But I don't want to rot in an apathetic existance either 
See
I want to believe you,
and I want to trust
and I want to have faith to put away the dagger 

But you lie, cheat, and steal 
And yet
I tolerate you 
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
while I smile and laugh and dance
and sing your praise and glory 
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
as I smile and laugh and dance
and sing your glory
while you
lie, cheat, and steal 
How can I tolerate you 

Our guilt,our blame ,
I've been far too sympathetic 
Our blood, our fault 
I've been far too sympathetic 

I am not innocent 
You are not innocent 
Noone is innocent 


It took so long to remember just what happened 
I was so young and vestal then,
you know it hurt me,
but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise 
I've got my hands bound,
my head down, my eyes closed,
and my throat wide open 

Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water,
I need to sleep a while 
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious 
Won't you come a bit closer,
close enough so I can smell you 
I need you to feel this,
I can't stand to burn too long 
Released in this sodomy 
For one sweet moment I am whole 

Do unto you now what has been done to me 

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
even if signs seem to tell me otherwise 
Won't you come just a bit closer,
close enough so I can smell you 
I need you to feel this 
I need this to make me whole 
There's release in this sodomy 
For I am your witness that
blood and flesh can be trusted 
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind 

Got your hands bound, your head down,
your eyes closed 
You look so precious now 

(Show me something
Thought I could make it end
Thought I could wash the stains away
Thought I could break the circle if I
Slipped right into your skin
So sweet was your surrender
We have become one
I have become my terror
And you my precious lamb and martyr )

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
shit blood and cum on my hands 

I've come round full circle 
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon 
You look so precious

There's a shadow just behind me,
shrouding every breath I take,
making every promise empty,
pointing every finger at me 
Waiting like a stalking butler
who upon the finger rests 
Murder now the path called "must we"
just before the son has come 
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
something but the past and done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over 
Why can't we drink forever 
I just want to start things over 

I am just a worthless liar 
I am just an imbecile 
I will only complicate you 
Trust in me and fall as well 
I will find a center in you 
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
just enough to bring you down 

Trust me 

Mother Mary won't you whisper
something but what's past and done 

Trust me 


My compassion is broken now  My will is eroded,
and my desire stolen and it makes me feel ugly 
I'm on my knees and burning 
My piss and moans are the fuel that set my head on fire 
So smell my soul burning 
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy 
I have swallowed the poison you feed me    
but I survive on it,
and it leaves me guilt fed, hatred fed, weakness fed  
and I feel ugly, and dead inside 

Shit adds up at the bottom 

You've left me no choice but to go inside and rebuild
what's broken 
Too much, too far, too late to lie down now 
I must arm myself to fight you
by making weapons out of my imperfections 
It's all I have left 
There's no other choice 
I'm shameless, nameless, nothing, and noone now 
But my soul must be iron for my fear is naked 
I'm naked and fearless 
But I'm dead inside 
You see   shit adds up, now I'm dead inside 
Hatred, weakness, and guilt keep me alive
at the bottom 


You crawled away from me 
Slipped away from me 
I tried to keep ahold,
but there was nothing I could say 
You slid and crept away
and there was nothing I could say 
So what you're trying to say
is you don't wanna play 
But what you want and what you need
doesn't mean fuck to me 

Because I can see your back is turning 
If I could I'd stick the knife in 

This is love 
This is my love for you 

Get up 

Now 

Say you won't go 


My warning meant nothing 
You're dancing in quicksand 
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in 
And you may never come back again 

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
when you're a stupid,dumb ass, beligerant fucker 

I hope it sucks you down 

Wander in and wandering 
Noone even invited you in 
But still you stumble in stumbling 
So suffocate
or get out while you can 

Noone told you to come 

I hope it sucks you down 


gone under two times 
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
speaks from deep
beneath the cold black water 
It's twice as clear as heaven,
and twice as loud as reason 
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
and just as undisturbing 
the currents mouth below me opens up around me 
suggests and beckons all while swallowing 
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away 

But I'm so comfortable   Too comfortable 

shut up shut up shut up shut up
shut up shut up shut up shut up
you're saturating me
So how could I let this bring me
back to my knees again again again

under for the third time 
I've been baptized by your voice 
it screams from deep beneath the endless water 
and it's half as high as heaven
and half as clear as reason 
it's cold and and black like silt on the riverbed 
But I'm so comfortable 
Far too comfortable 
Why don't you kill me,
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,
and I'm back on my knees 
lost in euphoria 
I'm back down  I'm in the undertow 
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow 
I'll die within your undertow 
It seems there's no other way out of this undertow 

Euphoria 


Get up and free yourself from yourself 

Locked up inside you,
like the calm beneath castles,
is a cavern of treasures that
noone has been to 
Let's go digging 
Bring it out to take you back in 

You won't do what you'd like to do 
Lay back and let me show you another way 
I'll kill what you want me to,
take what's left and eat it 
Take all or nothing 
Life's just too short to push it away 
Take it all 
Take it all in 
All the way in 
Let it go 
Let it go in 
You won't feel what you'd like to feel 
Lay back and let me show you another way 

If you knock me down I'll come back running,
knock you down,
it won't be long now
All the way in 
All the way 
Take it up higher 
4 degrees warmer 
Give in now
and let me in 
You'll like this in
Don't pull it out 
It brings us closer than
dying and cancer and crying 
Come on  
You can take it all 
Just like that 

Here comes the water 

All I knew and all I believed
are crumbling images
that no longer comfort me 
I scramble to reach higher ground,
some order and sanity,
or something to comfort me 

So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine,
suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine 
Soon the water will come
and claim what is mine 
I must leave it behind,
and climb to a new place now 

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be 

Thought I was high, and free 
I thought I was there
divine destiny 

I was wrong 
This changes everything 

The water is rising up on me 
Thought the sun would come deliver me,
but the truth has come to punish me instead 

The ground is breaking down right under me 
Cleanse and purge me
in the water 


And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber  And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself  And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest  And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil  One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear  And terror possesed me then 

And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?" 
And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! 

You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust " 
And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified 
brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, 
they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" 
Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus 

Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on        

This is necessary 

It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch  You looked up at your sky then 
 That made blue be your color 
 You had your knife there with you too 
 When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes  
 Your hands were sticky  You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green  
 Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this  
 You were already getting nervous again  
 Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up  
 Your head was almost empty  It always hurt you when you woke up like this 

You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you  You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it  "If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin " Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors  They were locked  It was a red car and it was new  There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat  Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods  You began to walk towards them  Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too
