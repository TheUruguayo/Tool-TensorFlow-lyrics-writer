Something has to change 
Un-deniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear 
Constant over stimu-lation numbs me
and I wouldn't have
It any other way 
It's not enough 
I need more 
Nothing seems to satisfy 
I don't want it 
I just need it 
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive 
Finger deep within the borderline 
Show me that you love me and that we belong together 
Relax, turn around and take my hand 
I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure 
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way 
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
Till you will not have me any other way 
It's not enough 
I need more 
Nothing seems to satisfy 
I don't want it 
I just need it 
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive 
Knuckle deep inside the borderline 
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to 
Relax  Slip away 
Something kinda sad about
the way that things have come to be 
Desensitized to everything 
What became of subtlety?
How can it mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging till
I feel something 
Elbow deep inside the borderline 
Show me that you love me and that we belong together 
Shoulder deep within the borderline 
Relax  Turn around and take my hand 
He had alot to say 
He had alot of nothing to say 
We'll miss him 
So long 
We wish you well 
You told us how you weren't afraid to die 
Well then, so long 
Don't cry 
Or feel too down 
Not all martyrs see divinity 
But at least you tried 
Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud 
We'll miss him 
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart 
We'll miss him 
No way to recall
What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all 
So loud 
You sure could yell 
You took a stand on every little thing
And so loud 
Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice so strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way, with
Someone who would die for me 
Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin lie 
Don't you step out of line 
Don't you fuckin lie 
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me 
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?
You had alot to say 
You had alot of nothing to say 
Come down 
Get off your fuckin cross 
We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr 
To ascend you must die 
You must be crucified
For your sins and your lies  [sic]
Goodbye   
What's coming through is alive 
What's holding up is a mirror 
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this piss to wine 
They're both totally void of hate,
But killing me just the same 
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been 
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again 
And I feel this coming over like a storm again 
Considerately 
Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty 
Drags me down like some sweet gravity 
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been 
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again 
And I feel this coming over like a storm again 
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away 
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me 
Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down 
And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times 
I could have cried then 
I should have cried then 
And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
and will die 
It's all right 
I don't mind 
I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away 
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me 
My shadow's
shedding skin and
I've been picking
Scabs again 
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue 
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been 
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in 
I wanna feel the changes coming down 
I wanna know what I've been hiding in
My shadow 
Change is coming through my shadow 
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again 
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been 
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
And insecure delusions 
I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in 
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured within
My shadow
Change is coming 
Now is my time 
Listen to my muscle memory 
Contemplate what I've been clinging to 
Forty-six and two ahead of me 
I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give and to
Move, learn and love and to
Cry, kill and die and to
Be paranoid and to
Lie, hate and fear and to
Do what it takes to move through 
I choose to live and to
Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and love and to
Do what it takes to step through 
See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me 
Soften this old armor 
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side 
Step into the shadow 
Forty six and two are just ahead of me 
Hm? You think you're cool, right? Hm? Hm?
When you kicked out people [out of] your house
I tell you this, one of three Americans die of cancer,
you know? Asshole  You're gonna be one of those 
I [don't have the] courage
to kick your ass directly 
Don't have enough courage for that,
I could, you know 
You know you're gonna have another accident?
You know I'm involved with black magic?
Fuck you  Die  Bastard 
You think you're so cool, hm? Asshole 
And if I ever see your fucking face around,
In Europe or Italy,
Well I'll -- That time I'm gonna kick your ass 
Fuck you  Fucking Americans, Yankee 
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise 
No one does what you did to me 
You wanna know something? Fuck you 
I want your balls smashed, eat shit  Bastard 
I hope somebody in your family dies soon 
Son of a bitch, do you know you are a piece of shit?
Piece of shit, son of a bitch 
Die, piece of shit, and go suck dicks on a plane!
I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s, and a
Dope Beastie t, nipple rings, and
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
From '92,
The first EP 
And in between
Sips of Coke
He told me that
He thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up
To the man 
Well now I've got some
A-dvice for you, little buddy 
Before you point the finger
You should know that
I'm the man,
And if I'm the man,
Then you're the man, and
He's the man as well so you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass 
All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck 
I sold out long before you ever heard my name 
I sold my soul to make a record,
Dip shit,
And you bought one 
So I've got some
Advice for you, little buddy 
Before you point your finger
You should know that
I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass 
All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck 
I sold out long before you ever heard my name 
I sold my soul to make a record,
Dip shit,
And you bought one 
All you read and
Wear or see and
Hear on TV
Is a product
Begging for your
Fatass dirty
Dollar
So   Shut up and
Buy my new record
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy
There are no words 
What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone 
Eleven is when we waved good-bye 
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him
By coming home 
Moving me with a sound 
Opening me within a gesture 
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven 
It took so long to realize that
You hold the light that's been leading me back home 
Under a dead ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light,
And wondering   
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping, lost, and numb 
So glad that I have found you 
I am wide awake and heading home 
Hold your light,
Eleven 
Lead me through each gentle step by step
by inch by loaded memory 
I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together 
Hold your light,
Eleven  Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory
'till one and one are one, eleven,
So glow, child, glow 
I'm heading back home 
I will choke until I swallow   
Choke this infant here before me 
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge and strike you down?
But you're
Pushing and shoving me 
You still love me and you pushit on me 
Rest your trigger on my finger,
bang my head upon the fault line 
Take care not to make me enter 
'cause if I do we both may disappear 
But you're pushing me,
Shoving me  Pushit on me 
Slipping back into the gap again 
I'm alive when you're touching me,
Alive when you're shoving me down 
But i'd trade it all
For just a little bit of
Piece of mind 
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be 
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see 
Never wanna see that place again 
Saw that gap again today
As you were begging me to stay 
Managed to push myself away,
And you, as well 
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way 
There's no love in fear 
Staring down the hole again 
Hands upon my back again 
Survival is my only friend 
Terrified of what may come 
Just remember I will always love you,
Even as I tear your fucking throat away 
But it will end no other way 
Some say the end is near 
Some say we'll see armageddon soon 
I certainly hope we will 
I sure could use a vacation from this
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away 
Any fucking time  Any fucking day 
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay 
Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your lawsuit and
Fret for your prozac and
Fret for your pilot and
Fret for your contract and
Fret for your car 
It's a
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away 
Any fucking time  Any fucking day 
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay 
Some say a comet will fall from the sky 
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves 
Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still 
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits 
Some say the end is near 
Some say we'll see armageddon soon 
I certainly hope we will cuz
I sure could use a vacation from this
Silly shit, stupid shit   
One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied 
Learn to swim 
Mom's gonna fix it all soon 
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be 
Learn to swim 
Fuck L Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones 
Fuck all those gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes 
Learn to swim 
Fuck retro anything 
Fuck your tattoos 
Fuck all you junkies and
Fuck your short memory 
Learn to swim 
Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas 
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses 
Learn to swim 
Cuz I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way 
I wanna watch it all go down 
Mom please flush it all away 
I wanna watch it go right in and down 
I wanna watch it go right in 
Watch you flush it all away 
Time to bring it down again 
Don't just call me pessimist 
Try and read between the lines 
I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend 
I wanna see it all come down 
suck it down 
flush it down 
14 (-) ions •
There are no words 
15 third eye •
Dreaming of that face again 
It's bright and blue and shimmering 
Grinning wide
And comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes 
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye 
In    Out    In    Out    In    Out   
A child's rhyme stuck in my head 
It said that life is but a dream 
I've spent so many years in question
to find I've known this all along 
"So good to see you 
I've missed you so much 
So glad it's over 
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play 
Why are you running?"
Shroud-ing all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me 
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun 
I stick my hand into his shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand 
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been 
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar 
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song   
"So good to see you 
I've missed you so much 
So glad it's over 
I've missed you so much 
Came out to watch you play 
Why are you running away?"
Prying open my third eye 
So good to see you once again 
I thought that you were hiding 
And you thought that I had run away 
Chasing the tail of dogma 
I opened my eye and there we were 
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me 
And you thought that I had run away 
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason 
Prying open my third eye 
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity 
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate 
Desperate to control all and everything 
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Terrified of being wrong  Ultimatum prison cell 
Saturn ascends, choose one or ten  Hang on or be humbled again 
Clutch it like a cornerstone  Otherwise it all comes down 
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end 
Saturn ascends, comes round again 
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten  Ignorant to the damage done 
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity 
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate 
Desperate to control all and everything 
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen 
Wear the grudge like a crown  Desperate to control 
Unable to forgive  And we're sinking deeper 
Defining, confining, controlling, and we're sinking deeper 
Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent 
Saturn comes back around  Lifts you up like a child or
Drags you down like a stone
To consume you till you choose to let this go 
Give away the stone 
Let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor 
Give away the stone 
Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold 
Let go 
A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful 
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on 
Draining patience, drain vitality 
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old 
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here 
Wait it out,
Gonna wait it out,
Be patient (wait it out) 
If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now 
Gonna wait it out 
If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now 
And I still may     (sigh)     I still may 
Be patient 
I must keep reminding myself of this 
And if there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now 
And I still may 
Gonna wait it out 
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering  Fundamental differing 
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication 
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over 
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it 
Finding beauty in the dissonance 
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away 
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication 
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers/brothers 
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now 
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful 
Wide eyed and hopefully wild 
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now  Hold on, stay inside   
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal  All this pain is an illusion 
We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment,
We are choosing to be here right now  Hold on, stay inside
This holy reality, this holy experience 
Choosing to be here in
This body  This body holding me  Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion 
Alive, I
In this holy reality, in this holy experience  Choosing to be here in
This body  This body holding me  Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion 
Twirling round with this familiar parable 
Spinning, weaving round each new experience 
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing 
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality 
Embrace this moment  Remember  We are eternal 
All this pain is an illusion 
Suck and suck 
Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck 
Workin up under my patience like a little tick 
Fat little parasite 
Suck me dry 
My blood is bruised and borrowed  You thieving bastards 
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue 
Hope this is what you wanted 
Hope this is what you had in mind 
Cuz this is what you're getting 
I hope you're choking  I hope you choke on this 
Taken all I can, taken all I can, we(?) can take 
Taken all you can, taken all you can fuckin' take
Got nothing left to give to you 
Blood suckin parasitic little tick/blood suckin parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go 
Hope this is what you wanted 
Hope this is what you had in mind 
Cuz this is what you're getting 
Suck me dry 
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you had in mind?
Cuz this this is what you're getting 
I hope you choke 
Black then white are all I see in my infancy 
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me 
lets me see 
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
drawn beyond the lines of reason 
Push the envelope  Watch it bend 
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind 
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines 
Black then white are all I see in my infancy 
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me 
lets me see there is so much more
and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities 
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
drawn outside the lines of reason 
Push the envelope  Watch it bend 
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind 
Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind 
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line 
Reaching out to embrace the random 
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come 
I embrace my desire to
feel the rhythm, to feel connected
enough to step aside and weep like a widow
to feel inspired, to fathom the power,
to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
to swing on the spiral
of our divinity and still be a human 
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
between the sounds and open wide to suck it in,
I feel it move across my skin 
I'm reaching up and reaching out,
I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me 
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been 
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been 
Spiral out  Keep going, going
Mention this to me
Mention something, mention anything
    and watch the weather change 
I have come curiously close to the end, down
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,
Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me   
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret - my confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
Its source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism 
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
Before I pine away 
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable 
Just let the light touch you
And let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason
before we pine away
